### About Me

I am an accomplished Associate Architect with over 13 years of experience in Mobile and Wearables Software Development. With a deep understanding of the challenges inherent in developing performant, robust, testable, and maintainable applicationsâ€”from requirement analysis to architecture, design, development, and maintenanceâ€”I am a valuable asset to any organization. My experience includes working on Samsung Health for iOS, an application boasting over 6 million users and approximately 160K DAU on the App Store market, with a global rating of 4.5. Between 2021 and 2024, 

I achieved six patent applications granted by Samsung SIPMS, currently in the process of being published in USPTO; among them, one patent has already been published in USPTO, WIPO, and KR. 

My technical expertise encompasses OOP, Android (Java, Kotlin), iOS (Swift, Objective-C), Xcode, Version Control Systems, System Design, Application Architecture, Development Processes, Wearable & Hearable Technology. Additionally, I have experience in Tizen app development and Windows app development. Currently, I am engaged in Samsung Earbuds device development on RTOS, specifically in music streaming over BT classic and LE Audio, as well as in ballistocardiogram signal processing for Stress score generation. 

My special interests include Technological Innovation, Human-Machine Interaction, Information Theory, Astronomy, Probability, Theory of Relativity, Philosophy of Science, Piano, Guitar, and Poetry. Furthermore, I have pursued studies in Critical Thinking and How to Make Valid Argumentation. 

I value the passion of problem-solving minds and firmly believe that Software Engineering is the profession that suits me best. I am always eager to learn and grow in my field and am committed to delivering high-quality solutions to my clients and stakeholders. I am open to engaging in discussions on any technological matters within my scope with interested individuals to share and acquire subject matter knowledge.
